## A Brief History
  This hobby originated from a small niche modding community who wanted more from their boards. Specifically, boards like the Topre switch-based [Happy Hacking Keyboard (HHKB)](https://www.hhkeyboard.com/uk/products/classic/) or the [DK Saver](https://geekhack.org/index.php?PHPSESSID=3eln55ahpfes72egu77cje6s6q0adcv5&topic=44030.0). Most of the knowledge and culture existed on the [Geekhack forum](https://geekhack.org/), where enthusiasts ran limited group buys fulfilled through Google Forms, trust, and PayPal payments. The group buy method, along with communal interest checks on ideas and concepts pre-group buy, still occur largely on Geekhack even today (although more out of tradition than anything). The group buy format remains the most prevalent method for purchasing; however, these usually now occur with full-time online vendors who interface with manufacturers, providing quality-checked consistency, and higher-scale purchase potential. 

  Similar to sneaker culture, getting your hands on some of the kits and other custom keyboard items is a balance of timing, patience, and sometimes a game of packet speed as group buys can sell out in seconds. The limited-run, time-sensitive nature of the buying process has begun to evolve as anti-botting aspects of storefronts are now being implemented to fend off flippers. Fortunately, the components suggested in this article are freely available almost year-round and provide the perfect starting point for someone who is just starting out with this hobby.  

  So now that we have some context, let’s talk about what makes up a custom keyboard. Custom keyboards are considered the gold standard typing experience because of the personal preference and detail they allow. 

## Form Factors
  Form factor refers to the keyboard’s size. Your everyday keyboard is referred to as a full-size (or 100%) and has 104 keys. Tenkeyless (TKL) is a full-size keyboard without the number pad, and typically contains 87 keys. These boards are also referred to as 80% boards. The trend continues with 75%, 60%, 40% and just about every gradation down to 2%, with portions of the board being removed and scaled down as the percentage drops. While these extremely small boards may seem impractical, many enthusiasts use them with a firmware called QMK to map to media and macro keys, use as separate numpads, or to simply flex a collection of hand-crafted artisan keycaps.

  There are also ergonomically (ergo) split boards that separate the board into two boards such as Ergodox, as well as varying layouts such as ortholinear (ortho) seen in 40% boards like the [OLKB Planck](https://olkb.com/collections/planck). Ergodox boards have a devout following as the columnar stagger alignment of keys has become the primary choice for ergonomic use. Ortholinear, which allows for pushing the limits of usability between scale and number of keymap layers, tends to draw a fairly innovative crowd. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEPg8kk84gw) gives an overview of what it’s like to use an ortholinear keyboard. 

  The main consideration as you increase the board’s size is that you may need more parts, which leads to higher costs. A safe bet is to begin with a 60% size board. Keyboards in this size offer an abundance of mostly plug-and-play parts and can be considered the closest thing to standardized that exists in the community. It is also a cheap place to start and experiment. The case of the board, determined by its form factor, can be plastic, wood, polycarbonate (PC), POM (Polyoxymethylene), brass, stainless steel, or machined aluminum. Higher-end versions of these cases also feature hefty metal weights in the bottom, innovative mounting solutions for the plate and to modify the typing feel, sound, and shock vibrations.
