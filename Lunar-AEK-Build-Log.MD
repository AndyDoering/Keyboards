# Lunar-AEK-Build-Log

![Finished Lunar](https://i.imgur.com/9A97brs.jpg)
Lunar AEK, M3501 Spacebar, JPAEK caps, M0116 Right Shift. Ultrasonic cleaned Cream dampened alps with tactile leaves removed. Lubed with finish line PTFE on the stems and 105g0 on the springs. The stabilizers were also lubed with 105g0. Interior of the case is lined with drawer liner as well. The ESC key is a similarly lubed MX conversion stem from TheKey.Company (to be able to showcase that beautiful Keypora).

I started with M3501 and M0116 AEK II boards. I purchased both froma  seller on ebay, and while they were dusty on the inside, they both had what I thought was a really nice color for their age.

Here you can see the M0116 better. I wound up also harvesting these awesome little  Macintosh logos. Once you disassemble the case via the screws on the bottom, you can use a small paperclip to push these out from the bottom. The caps were mostly surface dirt only thankfully, and were fairly easily cleaned. (More on that a little further down)

Here's the M3501. I wound up using this spacebar out of the three total I would wind up having.  I liked the color on it the best, and while I debated Retr0brighting, everything wound up looking the way I wanted in the end without needing to do that.

As I said the boards were a bit dusty, and I knew at this point that ultrasonic cleaning was going to be in order.

Once I got the boards disassembled and the PCBs out, I used an air compressor to blow out as much debris as possible. I bought green Alps originally for this build, but wound up going with the dampened creams you see above in the end. The top board had Salmons which I gave to a good friend for all his help in this build process.

![AEK II Cap Cleaning](https://i.imgur.com/THQ7KAz.jpg)
For cleaning the caps, I filled a large tupperware container with tap hot water and damn and left the caps to soak until the water was room temperature. From there I had cleaned each cap and then pat them dry and left them out to completely dry. You'll see some MX caps mixed in there as well, as I was simultaneously working on another build for a friend of mine. As I mentioned earlier the sets of caps I got seemed to be in pretty good condition. I checked the cap tops with the underside of other caps as well as the inner parts of the case and there was little difference, so I skipped retr0brighting.

Just a nice shot of the PCB before desoldering the boards.

A friend of mine /u/superuser41 is a gifted electronics expert and he lended his services in not only disassembling the boards but ultrasonic cleaning the switch components as well! If you need anything done for your board or builds I wold HIGHLY suggest you get in contact with him for all your service and repair needs!

I opened all the switches with the help of the Alps switch cracker from TheKey.Company. I found the tool to be a bit too tight at first, so I used a small file and a minute or so of quick filing which greatly improved the speed at which I could work. This little tool made this task so easy and I would highly recommend getting one if you're doing a build! Here you can see the components laid out as I separate them out for cleaning.

I used plastic cups to keep the components organized and separated. We wound up ultrasonic cleaning the top housings and the stems at 20 degrees Celsius for 5 minutes in distilled water with a bit of dawn mixed in. This seemed to work really well and protected the parts from any potential damage.

![ALPS Lubing](https://i.imgur.com/cekMpox.jpg)
I used a bag lubing method to lube these stems (and springs afterward with 105g0). You simply fill a small Ziploc bag with the stems and a bit of PTFE lube and then shake and bake until they all get an even coating. I then dumped them out onto aluminum foil to dry while I lubed the springs and prepared for reassembly. I rebuilt the cream switches as I said without the tactile leaves as I preferred that feel in the end.

Here's the board all put back together! I was too excited with building it finally to remember to take picture as the last stage of building. I used an MX converting stem purchased from TheKey.Company to be able to use the Alpha Keycaps Keypora I had been saving for this build. I think it matches really nicely and adds a bespoke character to the board. I wound up picking up a set of JPAEK caps from /u/LurkerMcNoPost who was a gem about getting in touch with me! He had remembered from an earlier purchase attempt that I was looking for a set and he reached out when he had another which I was very excited about.

I couldn't think of a better way to cap off this build that with some Suntory and a nice cigar after the fact. I think the board really came out nice and I'm really pleased with it for my first foray into the world of Alps.

Thanks for reading and here's to nice boards, good friends!
