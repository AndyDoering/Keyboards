# Private TKL - F-ROW less WKL TKL Private Group Buy


Hello, and welcome to the private group buy! 

This is the info page for the Private TKL, an F-ROW less, WinKeyLess dream of mine being produced with lots of help from Fropsie/Armani and Superuser. Simply put, I've always wanted an F-ROW less board, but few have come to fruition. The goal of this board is to produce something that is attractive, pairs well with a wide range of styles, and is pleasant to type on in the F-ROW less form factor. A proto version of this board has already been produced in full F-ROW TKL form factor ([see the SDTKL gallery here](https://github.com/AndyDoering/Keyboards/tree/main/Private-TKL/SDTKL-proto)), which Armani was extremely pleased with (note the side profile of the SDTKL proto is a slightly different). Since this is an extremely small private run, the aim is to minimize areas for failure and maximize quality, opting to do a few things well instead of offer everything possible.
