[/u/Langelandia](https://www.reddit.com/u/Langelandia/) and I worked together to design a keyset inspired by one of the most iconic devices in music production and beat making: the [Roland TR-808 Rhythm Composer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_TR-808), commonly known as The 808.

The 808 is a drum machine that was manufactured from 1980 to 1983 and has continued to influence drum beats for decades. It was one of the first to allow producers to program beats instead of having to choose from preset sounds and patterns. It was discontinued from production after only 12,000 units were made. Between the difficulty of stocking the semiconductors the 808 used, and analog synthesis sounds being ahead of their time (pre-electronic/hip-hop), the machine was eventually replaced by the [TR-909](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_TR-909).

The 808 features some of the most recognizable percussion sounds in music history and has been used on more hit records (either originally, or through track sampling) than any other drum machine. The booming bass lines, crisp snare, classic cymbals, and renowned congas, cowbells, and handclaps are what make this machine's sounds so celebrated and sampled.

We are proud to say that we apartnered with [Children’s Music Fund](https://www.thecmf.org/). They are a 501(c)(3) nonprofit dedicated to bringing music therapy into the lives of sick children to help overcome pain, fear, and anxiety. We donated 100% of designer profit, with [TheKey.Company](https://thekey.company/) matching a percentage, so that each Bass Kit sale gave $10 directly to the Children's Music Fund. A portion of the sales from every additional item sold was directly contributed to the fund as well. all in all the group buy raised ___$7000___ for tha charity. Ronda Grech, former president of CMF wrote us stating:

> What a remarkable response to your custom design! Congratulations!! Your fans where so kind with providing their support too. We saw incredible traffic to our website on the promotion weekend and an increase in social followers. On behalf of our board, volunteers, therapists, and most importantly, the amazing children we help, thank you for making a difference in their lives. Your generosity will provide 140 Music Therapy sessions to children in need. Please stay in touch. You will always be a part of our CMF Family. Thank you to all who joined and supported the CMF in other ways. Big <3 to you

We set out to produce a set that we were passionate about, as well as use the power of design for a greater good. We spent a lot of time considering how to support 40s folks, as well as Alice layout users, and boards of all sizes. We worked hard to design this set in such a way that it remains visually consistent throughout almost any keyboard layout, yet also offers users a range of options. We appreciate your feedback and insights, and look forward to your support in the future as we look to take this set through group buy.
